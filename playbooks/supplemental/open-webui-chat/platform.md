# Platform Configuration

This document describes the expected platform configuration for running this playbook.

## Required Apps/Frameworks

### Windows/Linux
Lemonade should be pre-installed from [here](https://lemonade-server.ai/install_options.html). 

- **Open WebUI** (frontend web app)
- **Lemonade Server** (backend model server)

> This playbook runs **Lemonade** (Lemonade server/app) **natively**. **Open WebUI** runs as a **container** on Linux (via Podman) and as a **Python package** on Windows. The `open-webui` PyPI package supports Python ≤ 3.12 only, so the Linux container avoids having to manage older Python versions.  

## Models (in Lemonade)

Models should be downloaded inside the **Lemonade app** (using the built-in Model Manager) or via Lemonade’s model management commands (`lemonade pull <model_name>`). This playbook assumes that the below recommended models are downloaded and show up in the models list endpoint.

Check model availability:
- Open: `http://localhost:13305/api/v1/models`
- Downloaded models will be listed under `"data"`.

### Recommended models

| Capability | Model ID | Notes |
|---|----|-----|
| LLM (Text input → Text output) | `Qwen3-4B-Hybrid` (or similar) | Any Lemonade LLM model for chat, text completion, coding, or reasoning |
| VLM (Image → Text) | `Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF` (or any model in the **Vision** category) | Any multimodal/vision-capable model that can take images as part of their input |
| Image Generation (Text → Image) | `SDXL-Turbo` (or any model in the **Image** category) | Any Stable Diffusion model that generates images for a text prompt |
| Audio (Speech → Text) | `Whisper-Large-v3` (or any model in the **Audio** category) | Any ASR model that converts audio into text |
